## Overview
AIRouter is a decentralized action engine designed to transform user intent into seamless, impactful outcomes across digital and physical realms. It empowers users with a network of autonomous, customizable AI agents that can execute complex tasks on-chain and in real-world scenarios.

## Key Features

- **On-Chain Action Execution**: AI agents that perform complex blockchain operations on Solana, including trading, NFT minting, and DAO governance.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Deploy specialized AI agents that work together seamlessly across different domains.
- **Energy-Driven System**: A gamified ecosystem where "Energy" powers agent actions, earned through holding AIROUTER tokens or engaging with the platform.
- **Decentralized Identity**: Secure, user-controlled agent identities bound to Solana wallets and Telegram accounts.
- **Agent Marketplace**: Browse, subscribe to, or customize AI agents created by the community.

## Technical Architecture

- **Agent Engine**: Powered by advanced NLP and reinforcement learning to interpret user intent and execute actions.
- **Action Modules**: Modular framework for diverse tasks like trading, NFT creation, and social media management.
- **Task Scheduler**: Automation system for recurring tasks with reliability and precision.
- **Energy System**: Resource manager tied to the AIROUTER token economy.
- **Identity & Permission Layer**: Security system using Solana wallets and Telegram for authentication.
