# Agent Engine

The Agent Engine is the core AI processing component of the AIRouter platform, responsible for interpreting user intent and orchestrating actions.

## Components

- `models/` - Data models for agents and their configuration
- `services/` - Core agent services including NLP processing, intent recognition, and action planning
- `adapters/` - Adapters for various AI services and models
- `utils/` - Utility functions for the agent engine

## Features

- Advanced natural language processing for understanding user requests
- Intent classification and entity extraction
- Context management for maintaining conversation state
- Action planning and execution
- Learning capabilities for improving over time

## Technical Details

The Agent Engine uses a combination of:

- Language models for understanding and generating natural language
- Reinforcement learning for decision making
- Semantic memory for maintaining context
- Action graph generation for planning complex tasks

## Integration

The Agent Engine interfaces with:

- Action Modules for task execution
- Identity system for user authentication
- Energy system for action resource management
- Scheduler for automated task execution

## Configuration

Agent behavior can be customized through configuration files and environment variables. See the configuration directory for details on available options.
